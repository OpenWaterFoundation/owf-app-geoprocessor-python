# GeoProcessor / Development Environment / Git #

Git and GitHub are used for version control.
Install and configure Git as per a typical software project.
For example, use Git for Windows for command line Git client.
The Git features of PyCharm or other Git client can also be used.

* [Git downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* For Cygwin, install the Git software in the Cygwin setup tool.
* For Linux, install Git software using `apt-get` or other install tool.

The GeoProcessor project uses a "feature branch" workflow where the `master` branch is the current branch under development,
with tags and stable release branches made as necessary for releases.
