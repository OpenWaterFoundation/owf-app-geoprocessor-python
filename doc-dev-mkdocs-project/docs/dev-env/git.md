# Git #

Git and GitHub are used for version control.
Install and configure Git as per a typical software project.
For example, use Git for Windows.

The GeoProcessor project uses a "feature branch" workflow where the `master` branch is the current branch under development,
with tags and stable release branches made as necessary for releases.
