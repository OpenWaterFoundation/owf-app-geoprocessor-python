## Developer Documentation ##

Developer documentation uses the MkDocs software.
See the [developer documentation in the main code repository](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-app-geoprocessor-python/blob/master/doc-dev-mkdocs-project/README.md).
The developer documentation is maintained with the code since it needs to be kept consistent with changes in the code.

## User Documentation ##

User documentation uses the MkDocs software.
See the [user documentation repository](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-app-geoprocessor-python-doc-user).
The user documentation is maintained in a separate repository simplify contributions by non-programmers.
