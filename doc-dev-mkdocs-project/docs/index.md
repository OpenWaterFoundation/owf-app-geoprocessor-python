# Open Water Foundation / GeoProcessor (for Developers) #

This documentation provides resources to learn how to develop the
Open Water Foundation (OWF) GeoProcessor software,
which automates processing spatial data.
**The GeoProcessor software is under development as an open source software project at the Open Water Foundation.**

This documentation is intended for GeoProcessor developers that have experience with Python,
QGIS Python libraries, and Python development environment.
The PyCharm Community Edition is used by the Open Water Foundation as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
although other tools could be used.
PyCharm project files are not included in the repository.

The primary development environment at the Open Water Foundation
is currently Windows 10 using the latest stable QGIS 3.x release.
The primary deployment environments are Windows 7/10, Cygwin, and Ubuntu/Debian Linux.
A QGIS-based `gp` distribution is available on Windows for geospatial processing.
A non-QGIS `gptest` distribution is also available,
in order to use the GeoProcessor workflow as a function test framework.
Additional environments may be supported depending on funding and developer resources.
