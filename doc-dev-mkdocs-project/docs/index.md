# Open Water Foundation / Learn GeoProcessor (for Developers)#

This documentation provides resources to learn how to develop the OWF GeoProcessor software,
which automates processing of spatial data.

This documentation is intended for GeoProcessor developers that have experience with Python,
QGIS Python libraries, and Python development environment.
The PyCharm Community Edition is used by the Open Water Foundation as the Integrated Development Environment,
although other tools can be used.
PyCharm project files are not included in the repository.

The primary development environment at the Open Water Foundation
is currently Windows 10 using the latest stable QGIS 2.x release.
Support for QGIS 3.x will be added after sufficient vetting.
The primary deployment environments are Windows 7/10, and Ubuntu/Debian Linux.
A non-QGIS distribution is also available,
in order to use the GeoProcessor workflow as a "function test" framework.
Additional environments may be supported depending on funding and developer resources.

**The GeoProcessor software is currently under development at the Open Water Foundation.
Documentation and tests are being published to facilitate collaboration and evaluation by potential software users.
The software will be published as an open source software project once a critical mass of initial functionality is
in place, with appropriate tests and documentation.**
