# Learn GeoProcessor / Introduction #

There is often a need to automate processing of spatial data, ranging from simple to complex tasks.
For example, the Open Water Foundation often processes spatial data related to water resources,
such as processing river basin data.
Although open source and commercial Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software tools are available,
the features of these tools are limited and in some cases are expensive to purchase.
There is a need for tools that can automate spatial data processing without requiring extensive GIS skills.

## GeoProcessor Features ##

See the [OWF / Learn GeoProcessor](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-app-geoprocessor-python-doc-user/)
documentation for users, which explains the product.

## GeoProcessor Open Source Project ##

The Open Water Foundation is involved in multiple open source software projects.
Some significant projects such as the OpenCDSS project for the State of Colorado,
involve moving government-funded software to full open source projects.

The GeoProcessor is one of the first major projects that OWF has undertaken as an OWF project.
The goal is to provide a significant new option for geoprocessing software while also
supporting ongoing and new OWF projects.
Demonstrating the software to the water resources community will hopefully result in streamlined
data processing and analysis, allowing the community to focus on solutions to difficult problems.
Through application, OWF hopes to enhance the software over time to address more and more water resources problems.

The GeoProcessor design and features are similar to the TSTool software.
TSTool has proven to be a powerful tool for automating time series analysis.
A goal for the GeoProcessor is to provide similar features for spatial data processing.
If successful, the combination of TSTool and GeoProcessor will provide significant capabilities
for water resources data analysis.
