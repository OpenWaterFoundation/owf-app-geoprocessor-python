# GeoProcessor / Introduction #

There is often a need to automate processing of spatial data, ranging from simple to complex tasks.
For example, the Open Water Foundation often processes spatial data related to water resources,
such as processing river basin data to better understand water resources issues.
Although open source (e.g., QGIS) and commercial (e.g., Esri ArcGIS)
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software tools are available,
the features of these tools are limited and in some cases are expensive to purchase.
There is a need for tools that can automate spatial data processing without requiring extensive GIS skills.

## GeoProcessor Features ##

The GeoProcessor provides a command language for automating geospatial data processing in workflows.
This allows processing to be efficiently repeated and workflows can be shared between GeoProcessor software users.
Workflows can be maintained in version control.

See the [GeoProcessor documentation for users](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-app-geoprocessor-python-doc-user/)
documentation for users, which explains the GeoProcessor features.

## GeoProcessor Open Source Project ##

The Open Water Foundation is involved in multiple open source software projects that
seek to increase access to data and improve transparency on complex water issues.

The GeoProcessor is one of the first major projects that OWF has undertaken as an independent OWF product.
The goal is to provide a significant new option for geoprocessing software that leverages and enhances
existing GIS platforms including QGIS and ArcGIS Pro.
OWF accepts funding to enhance the software, provide training,
and implement the software on projects.

The GeoProcessor design and features are similar to the
[TSTool software](http://openwaterfoundation.org/software-tools/tstool),
although the GeoProcessor is written in Python and TSTool is written in Java.
TSTool has proven to be a powerful tool for automating time series analysis.
A goal for the GeoProcessor is to provide similar features for spatial data processing.
If successful, the combination of TSTool and GeoProcessor will provide significant capabilities
for water resources data analysis.
