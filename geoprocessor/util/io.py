def to_absolute_path(parent_dir, path):
    """
    Convert an absolute "parent_dir" and path to an absolute path.
    If the path is already an absolute path it is returned as is.
    If the path is a relative path, it is joined to the absolute path "parent_dir" and returned.
    This is a port of the Java IOUtil.toAbsolutePath() method.

    Args:
        parent_dir (str): Directory to prepend to path, for example the current working directory.
        path (str): Path to append to parent_dir to create an absolute path.
                   If absolute, it will be returned.
                   If relative, it will be appended to parent_dir.
                   If the path includes "..", the directory will be truncated before appending the non-".."
                   part of the path.

    Returns:
        The absolute path given the provided input path parts.

def verify_path_for_os(path):

    Verify that a path is appropriate for the operating system.
    This is a simple method that does the following:
    - If on UNIX/LINUX, replace all \ characters with /.

      Windows drive letters are not changed, so this works best with relative paths.
    - If on Windows, replace all / characters with \
