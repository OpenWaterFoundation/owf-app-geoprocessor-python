# notices #

These files contain copyright/license notices that are inserted into source files.
In the future, the notice can be updated (for example change ending year)
and a script used to automatically update all files.

* `notice-insert-bat.txt` - notices to use for Windows `*.bat` files 
* `notice-insert-python.txt` - notices to use for Python files
(as per PEP the `#` is followed by a space to avoid warnings in PyCharm).
