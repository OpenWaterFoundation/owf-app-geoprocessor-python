# qt-stylesheets #

The files in this folder are stylesheets for Qt, to customize UI appearance.
Ideally, setting the global style in the application depending on platform will work well.
However, sometimes it is necessary to override with custom configurations.
This can be difficult to do with different devices and display resolutions.

Files include:

* `gp.qss` - default Qt stylesheet for GeoProcessor UI
