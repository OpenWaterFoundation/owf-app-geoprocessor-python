# venv/ #

This folder contains Python virtual environments used by PyCharm to develop the GeoProcessor software.
The virtual environments are initialized from a QGIS Python version and are named similar to the following,
using QGIS version 3.10 as an example.

| **Virtual Environment Folder** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
| `venv-qgis-sa-3.10-python37` | Stand-alone QGIS version 3.10 using Python 3.7 from QGIS (`C:\Program Files\QGIS 3.10\apps\Python7`). |
| `venv-qgis-osgeo-3.10-python37` | OSGeo4W QGIS version 3.10 using Python 3.7 from QGIS (`C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python37`) - note that the QGIS version cannot be determined from the path. |

The developer documentation describes how PyCharm, QGIS, Python, and repository files are integrated.
